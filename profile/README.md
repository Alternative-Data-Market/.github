<strong>Factors Affecting the Growth of the Alternative Data Industry:</strong>

The unstructured data space of the alternative data market is witnessing a growing demand for unstructured data including satellite imagery (from imagery data) and sentiment analysis (from social media data), and audio transcript data.

Companies in finance, logistics, and even retail that utilize unstructured data for richer, more nuanced and real time insights on alternative data will have distinct competitive advantages.

The diffusion of alternative data shows its breadth of use as it enables organizations to identify how and where they can use the information to improves decisions across several use cases.
